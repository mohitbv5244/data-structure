# data-structure

The Queue data structure is implemented using Linked list.
Queue follows a data structure such as FIFO(First in First out).
We have tow pointers such as front and rear.
The elements are inserted from the rear and deleted from the 
front. To see the contents of the arrar, we copy the address of the
front pinter to a temporary pointer and display the values in the Queue
until we reach the rear pointer address.
