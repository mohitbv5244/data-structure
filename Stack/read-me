The Stack data structure is implemented using Linked list.
Stack follows a data structure such as LIFO(Last in First out).
We have a pointer Top to know the address of the last element in the Stack.
The elements are inserted from the rear and deleted from the 
rear. To see the contents of the Stack, we copy the address of the
rear pointer to a temporary pointer and display the values in the Stack.
