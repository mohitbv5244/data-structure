The binary search tree is a non-linear data structure.
A tree is called binary search tree, when the elements in the 
left sub tree is less than or equal to the root node and the elements in the
right sub tree are greater than root node.

We can use the recursion method to insert the element to the tree by using the
root address. We add the elements to the left sub tree when the elements are
lesser than or equal to the element in the root node, and add the elements to the 
right sub tree when the elements are greater than the element in the root node.

We can traverse the tree using different ways:
1) Preorder
2) Post order
3) Inorder

1) Preorder: root, left and right: we first access the root node and then the left node and right node
2) Postprder: left, right, root: we first access the left node and then the right node and root node. 
3) Inorder: left, root,right: we first access the left node and then the root node and right node.
